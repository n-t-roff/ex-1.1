When the system crashes or the editor bombs you should be able to
recover the buffer you were working on to within a few lines of
changes of where you were.
When the system reboots, you may receive
mail telling you the name associated with the buffer which was saved.
You can then recover this file by executing the editor
in the directory where the file belongs and giving the editor the command:
.sp
.ti +8
recover name
.sp
where "name" should be replaced by the name of
the file you lost.

Before writing out the retrieved file buffer you should note the
date it was saved.
It is possible for more than one buffer to be saved for a particular file.
In this case, a single "recover" command will retrieve one of these
(arbitrarily).
To get the other saved buffers you can issue more "recover" commands.

a file do "help saferecover";  for information on the "lost lines"
diagnostic during recovery do "help lostlines".
