If you get a message indicating that lines were lost during a
"recover" command, this means
that the data base the editor saved indicating your files state
at the point of crash was inconsistent and that a few of the
lines could not be saved.
These will always be the last few
lines you changed, and the text of these lines will be replaced by
the string "LOST" so that they will be easy to find.
