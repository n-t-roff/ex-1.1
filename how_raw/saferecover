It is good practice to write
a recovered file to a new file and to use the 
"diff" command to
make sure that the recovered file is "sensible" before continuing.
Thus after recovering a copy of the file "name" we might issue
the editor command:
.sp
.ti +8
write newname
.sp
and then leave the editor and do a
.sp
.ti +8
diff name newname
.sp
If all seems ok then we can
.sp
.ti +8
mv newname name
.sp
and continue by editing the file "name" as usual.
