Update to Ex Version 1.1 Documentation
.ce
.DA
.sp 2
.LP
This sheet is a quick update to Ex version 1.1 documentation for features
which were added after the documentation was prepared.
.SH
Crash Recovery
.PP
The crash recovery mechanism has been improved to recover mangled buffers
and to mail to users that their files were lost after a crash.
More information is available in ex "help".
It is also possible to recover a buffer which had no current file name;
it is saved as though it were named "LOST".
.SH
Smaller Screens in Visual
.PP
A new, partially implemented feature, is smaller visual screens.
You can specify a smaller window size for visual by
.DS
set window=10
.DE
or on the "visual" command, similarly to the "z" command, i.e.:
.DS
vi.5
.DE
.SH
Visual features \- Unimplemented, 11/34's and 11/40's
.PP
The visual operations ``e'', ``E'', ``<'' and ``>'', which were
.I unimplemented
in the documentation are, in fact,
available on 11/45's and 11/70's but not on 11/34's and 11/40's due
to space problems.
In addition, the sequences ``^CTRL(d)'' and ``0CTRL(d)'' are not
available with
.I autoindent
in
.I visual
and
.I open
modes on the smaller machines.
.SH
Future visual changes
.PP
The following additions to
.I visual
are contemplated:
.IP 1)
An operation `V' to dynamically respecify the window size.
With no argument, `V' will set the window size to the maximum possible,
this being rather innocuous.
.IP 2)
Operations to deal with LISP S-Expressions.
.IP 3)
Handling of intelligent terminals.
