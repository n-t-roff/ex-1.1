     When the system crashes or the editor bombs you should be able to
recover  the  buffer  you  were  working  on  to within a few lines of
changes of where you were.  When the system reboots, you  may  receive
mail  telling you the name associated with the buffer which was saved.
You can then recover this file by executing the editor in the directo-
ry where the file belongs and giving the editor the command:

        recover name

where "name" should be replaced by the name of the file you lost.

     Before writing out the retrieved file buffer you should note  the
date  it  was  saved.   It  is possible for more than one buffer to be
saved for a particular file.  In this case, a single "recover" command
will  retrieve  one  of  these  (arbitrarily).  To get the other saved
buffers you can issue more "recover" commands.

     For more information about precautions you should take  when  re-
covering  a  file do "help saferecover";  for information on the "lost
lines" diagnostic during recovery do "help lostlines".
