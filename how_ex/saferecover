     It is good practice to write a recovered file to a new  file  and
to  use  the  "diff"  command  to make sure that the recovered file is
"sensible" before continuing.  Thus after recovering  a  copy  of  the
file "name" we might issue the editor command:

        write newname

and then leave the editor and do a

        diff name newname

If all seems ok then we can

        mv newname name

and continue by editing the file "name" as usual.
