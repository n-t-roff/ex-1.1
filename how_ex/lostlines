lostlines                      12/15/77                      lostlines

     If you get a message indicating that lines  were  lost  during  a
"recover"  command, this means that the data base the editor saved in-
dicating your files state at the point of crash was  inconsistent  and
that  a few of the lines could not be saved.  These will always be the
last few lines you changed, and the text of these lines  will  be  re-
placed by the string "LOST" so that they will be easy to find.
