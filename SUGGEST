Ex will start much faster if it doesn't have to do a "ttyn".
This can be (essentially) eliminated by using the program "makeTtyn"
to generate a "Ttyn" which hashes major and minor device number.
All you have to do then is change the (one) ttyn call in ex_init.c
to call "Ttyn". The startup speed change can be striking.
