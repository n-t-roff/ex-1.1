change
.I "Open and visual targets"
to

.SH
Crash Recovery
.PP
It is no longer true that you must have had a current file name to recover
after a crash;
files with no name are arbitrarily named ``LOST''.
.PP
Also note that if the system crashes you will receive mail when it comes
up telling you of the name of the file saved for you if you were in the
editor.
.SH
File command
.PP
The
.I file
command description should begin
``The current filename''
not
``The current file''
as the editor does not have a current file,
only a current filename associated with a buffer.
.SH
Visual Command
.PP
The
.I visual
command may take a trailing count indicating the number of lines to
be used (physical) in the window.
The default for this count is the value of the
.I window
option.
.SH
Visual Operations
.PP
The operations ``e'', ``E'', ``<'' and ``>'' are implemented unless
you are on a machine without separate I/D space (Evans "D" system)
in which case the features
``0CTRL(d)'' and ``^CTRL(d)'' with
.I autoindent
in
.I open
and
.I visual
also don't work.
.SH
Ex manual section
.PP
Add the following bugs:
.IP
Lines which are
.I changed
or
.I joined
lose marks;
it would be better for the marks to be attached to the (first)
new line.
.IP
There should be an option for maintaining a perfectly clean screen in
.I visual
and open
on very fast (or intelligent) terminals.
.SH
