To have a fully functioning recovery mechanism you should
place a command of the form
	/usr/lib/expreserve -a
in /etc/rc if you clean out the directory /tmp there.
For full security, exrecover and expreserve should be setuid root
and the directory /usr/preserve should be mode 700.
If you don't need or want this, change "install" and "setup".
